Assumptions to run the program:
First of all you need to enter your name and the level of the game.
Then the game starts ,initially you have three lives and the score is zero.
Each time you slice a normal fruit the score increases with one point and if you slice a special fruit the score increases with five points.
But if you slice a fatal bomb ,you lose and if you slice a dangerous bomb you lose a life and if you slice the dangerous bomb three times you lose.
Also if a fruit drops off the screen without being sliced you lose a life.
Then you get to choose to play again with the same player or make a new game with a new player or you exit the whole game.
Your score is written in the xml file(score.xml) and each time you beat your best score the file gets updated with the new score.
